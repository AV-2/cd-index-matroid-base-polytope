# cd-index-matroid-base-polytope
Code for computing the cd-index of the base polytope of a matroid.
Version: 0.2

In an open session of sage type: 

```python
load("CDcalculate.sage")
```

This will load the functions required for calculating the CD-index and compute a few examples.

N.B. This version of the program corrects a sign error present in version 0.1. An extended abstract of the corresponding article reports results computed with version 0.1, thus the output is wrong. The correct output is given by version 0.2 onwards.
